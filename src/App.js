                    I am a passionate and motivated Senior Software Engineer who
                    has 5 years professional experience within the financial
                    technology industry. I have worked with a wide range of
                    technologies and systems, some of which include: distributed
                    systems, RESTful APIâ€™s, microservice architecture, event
                    driven architecture, database modelling, batch processing
                    and many more. I have a deep and extensive knowledge of
                    product driven design and a strong record of delivering
                    impactful solutions within the financial technology sector.
                    I engineer smart and simple software solutions for products
                    that aim to solve complex problems within the industry.

                    In terms of career progression, I have recently taken an
                    interest in leveraging AI and ML within my skillset in order
                    to produce more robust and data driven engineering solution
                    design. I wish to extend my knowledge within that area into
                    a product space outside of the financial sector. I am keen
                    to understand more problems that exist in the technology
                    sector to build upon my problem solving capacity. I also
                    enjoy game design and development in my personal time and
                    would also be interested in exploring that space
                    professionally.
